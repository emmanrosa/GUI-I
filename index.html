      <h2>Academic Project</h2>
      <hr />
      <ul>
	<li>Project:<a href="https://github.com/emmanrosa">GitHub</a></li>
	<li>N-Body Simulation - Computer IV
	  <ul>
	    <li>Using Newton's laws and the “leapfrog finite difference approximation” method to create a realistic, animated simulation of planetary motion in our solar systemusing C++ and Linux OS to produced GUIs using the Simple Fast Media Library (SFML).</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Kronos Time Clock: Full Challenge - Computer IV
	  <ul>
	    <li>This project the result of a partnership with Kronos, a local company in Chelmsford, MA. The
	      goal was to parse large error log files generated by malfunctioning InTouch devices (their hardware time-clock unit) using regular expression and time-parsing libraries using C++ and Linux OS.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>Producer Hero - Organization of Programming Languages
	  <ul>
	    <li>Worked in a team of two to implement an application using Racket that use the keyboard to generate an RSound and the end user can channel their inner producer to create a beat. The application allows the user to record the beat they've generated and play it back.</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
	<li>UML Books - Mobile App Programming
	  <ul>
	    <li>Worked in a team of two to implement an Android application using java. We made UML Books to give UML students a safe, secure way to sell, buy or trade their textbooks with other UML students. We used firebase and Google’s text recognition.</li>
